/*Given a keypad as shown in diagram, and an N digit number. List all words which are possible by pressing these numbers.



Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line of each test case is N, N is the number of digits. The second line of each test case contains D[i], N number of digits.

Output:
Print all possible words from phone digits with single space.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You just need to complete the function possibleWords that takes an array as parameter and prints all the possible words. The newline is automatically added by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10
2 <=  D[i] <= 9

Example:
Input:
